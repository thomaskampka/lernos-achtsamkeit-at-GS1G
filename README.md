The lernOS Guide ***Achtsamkeit 4.2 - Dein Weg ist das Ziel*** is part of [lernOS](https://lernos.org). The guide is intended to help mindfulness learners to kick-start their self-directed emergence to integrate mindfulness practices into their life.

This version is a fork for the GS1 Germany Organization for the internal transformation initiative 'Road To Happiness', starting the first cycle with three circles in November 2021. Therefore, not all links in the texts are accessable.
